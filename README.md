## Database Schema

The application's data is structured within the `Rentals` schema, designed to support all the features and user roles described above.

* **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: The overall structure and relationships between entities are visualized in the ERD provided.
      For a quick visual overview of the database structure:

    * **Click for Detailed ERD (SVG)**: You can view a high-resolution, zoomable version of the ERD by clicking [here](images/Rentals_SVG.svg).
* **Database Definition Language (DDL)**: The detailed table definitions, including columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign key constraints, are specified in the DDL script. This script sets up the `Rentals` schema and all its tables, including various lookup tables for maintaining data consistency (e.g., `PropertyType`, `RentalType`, `LayoutType`, `AvailabilityStatus`, `PreferredTenants`, `AmenityCategory`, `MessageStatus`, `VisitRequestStatus`, `BookingRequestStatus`, `PaymentStatus`, `ReportStatus`, `RoleName`, `SubscriptionUserType`).

You can visualize the database schema using the dbdiagram.io code provided previously. Simply paste the code into [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to generate an interactive diagram.
